# swd1a-test-notebooks
Testing out ways to host SWD1a notebooks to better implement pedagogical methods.

The aim is for the Colab links to be directly embedded in each page of the course notes, so we don't have an additional website for the students to have to keep track of; perhaps even a single page with links to all the notebook.
